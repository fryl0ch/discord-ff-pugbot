### General Gameplay

- Pickups are not public gameplay. It is our competitive version of Fortress Forever.
- Playing ff_training is recommended. Please try and learn the basics (bhopping and concing) in order to play in pickup games.
- Pickup games are typically 4v4, but if everyone agrees, 2v2, 3v3, etc. can be changed with !players 4 or !players 6
- After the pickup is filled (in #PICKUP_CHANNEL) then players will have to !nominate 3 maps.
- If the pickup has filled, and players have nominated 3 maps, then a map vote will start.
- After the map is selected, the pickup's admin will select captains typically.
- Captains pick their teams and everyone votes to repick or not.
- After the map and teams have been agreed upon, the pickup bot should move you to the correct discord voice channels and it's time to join the server.
- The bot should send you the password of the server.
- If you do not receive the password, Type !sendinfo in #pickup and the bot will send you the password.
- All players must type ".r" in the pickup server in game to show you are ready to start the game.
